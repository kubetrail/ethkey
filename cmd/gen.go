var genCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "gen",
	Short: "Generate key from mnemonic",
	Long: `This command generates private/public keys
from mnemonic and optional secret passphrase per BIP-32 spec.

Alternatively, a seed in hex format can be provided bypassing
all mnemonic related computation and be directly used for
key generation

The keys are generated based on a chain derivation path
Path     |   Remark
---------|--------------------------------------------------------------
m        |   Master key (aka root key)
m/0      |   First child of master key
m/0'     |   First hardened child of master key
m/0/0    |   First child of first child of master key
m/0'/0   |   First child of first hardened child of master key
m/0/0'   |   First hardened child of first child of master key
m/0'/0'  |   First hardened child of first hardened child of master key

Per BIP-44 spec, the derivation path for ETH takes the form:
m/44'/60'/0'/0/0, where 44 refers to the purpose being satisfying
BIP-44 spec, 60 being the ETH blockchain identifier and rest of the
items being specific to account.

Mnemonic language can be specified from the following list:
1. English (default)
2. Japanese
3. ChineseSimplified
4. ChineseTraditional
5. Czech
6. French
7. Italian
8. Korean
9. Spanish

BIP-39 proposal: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki

Please note that same keys will be generated for mnemonics from different languages
if the underlying entropy is the same. In other words, keys are always
generated after translating input mnemonic to English.

To generate keys, first optionally create a new mnemonic:
$ bip39 gen --length=12

Then use the mnemonic to create the ETH keys:
$ ethkey gen
Enter mnemonic: cushion cover cupboard brother quiz board busy loyal kidney slogan catch pencil

unmarshal it separately to raw Public key data structure.
